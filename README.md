# llm-seed-url-generator
Experimental Repository of Seed URL generator using LLM for use with a web crawler

Still needs work for actual implementation. (Concept stage, implemented version coming soon)

Update: 8/14/2023: Made an implemented version of API working with Llama 2. 
(llm-seed-url-generator-working.py)

Update: 8/23/2023: test-llama-13b.py wasn't working anymore so I made a fixed version and uploaded it here.

Update: 9/1/2023: Added llm-seed-generator2.py. Still work in progress, but it now extracts sentences from the output from Llama 2 by a simple method and jsonifies (jsonify) it. 
It now needs to make URL that will send the sentences extracted to a search engine query for this script to be fully implemented to make it be crawled with a web crawler.
